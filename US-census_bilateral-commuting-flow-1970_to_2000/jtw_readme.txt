Census Journey to Work

The Census Bureau is the source for this information. 
See Journey to Work and Place of Work Data on the 
Census Bureau web site-- 
http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/journey.html

There are three files in this archive containing
Journey to Work data. It is recommended that they be
imported into a database rather than a spreadsheet, as
most spreadsheet programs could not handle the number 
of records in the larger files.
